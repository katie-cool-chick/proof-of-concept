# Proof of Concepts

Repository with one proof of concept per directory.

## Guidelines

* Use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to track tool versions
* Use debian or debian derived docker image for most initial concepts
* Dockerfile must parameterize versions as args
* Provide a docker-compose.yaml to build the docker image
